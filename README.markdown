# Admin CSS Override

This extension allows overriding admin CSS styles by CSS rules placed in
`assets/admin_css_override_print.css`. The extension simply appends the
`admin_css_override_print.css` stylesheet to the head of admin pages.


## Installation

1. Upload the `admin_css_override_print` folder in this archive to your Symphony 
   'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Admin CSS Override Print", choose Enable from the 
   with-selected menu, then click Apply.


## Usage

- Place your CSS rules in `assets/admin_css_override_print.css`. 


## Updating

If you ever update this extension, DO NOT OVERWRITE your stylesheet
(`admin_css_override_print.css`) file. (Just in case: You DO have a backup of your
website, don't you?)
